# MacBook Setup Guide

This is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you setup a new MacBook Pro. Before we start, please take note of the following items:

- It is assumed you are using the latest model of MacBook Pro (at least after 2016).
- It is also assumed that you have installed the latest version of MacOS (at least `10.12 Sierra`).
- This guide is tailor-made for a developer or software engineer's personal laptop.
    - In other words, we would install the required tools for personal development. However, we would not focus on tools that are organization-specific.
- This guide is also customized for certain region (Asia/Singapore) & languages (English and Mandarin).

## Background

At the time of writing, I am a [Computer Engineering](http://ceg.nus.edu.sg) undergraduate at the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) as well as a software development enthusiast.

One day, I received an email from [Apple](https://www.apple.com) with the title _"Important information about your MacBook Pro"_. It said that my MacBook _has an issue that may result in data loss and failure of the drive (SSD)._ See [this page](https://www.apple.com/sg/support/13-inch-macbook-pro-solid-state-drive-service-program/) for more information. Apple offered to provide a service program to fix this problem _(by updating the driver firmware)_ free of charge. So I registered and sent the device to an Apple Authorized Service Provider - [A.Lab](https://www.alab.sg).

I am aware that all data will be erased after the service. However, I am fine with that since almost all important data on my device have been backed up. Nonetheless, I still need an SOP (standard operating procedure) to setup (or re-setup) my MacBook after the service. Thus, I decided to document this process here.

Please notice this guide is opinionated. The following philosophical rules are enforced:

- **Be stingy**: install the minimal set of tools you need. Whenever a new software is installed, a new potential vulnerability is introduced.
- **Be Apple's fan**: use tools provided by Apple by default (opt to an external tool only when absolutely necessary). For example, we use [iTerms 2](https://www.iterm2.com) rather than the [default terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac
). However, we would stick with the default [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) and never use [zsh](http://www.zsh.org).

## Steps

1. Create a new user account on MacOS:
    - This should be done when you turn on your device for the first time;
    - Set this account as an `administer`;
    - The `full name` field should be your full real name in English (use a single space to separate each word, first letter of which should be captialized);
    - The `account name` field should be your first name in English (all lowercase, alphanumeric only);
    - Do not leave the `password` blank;
    - Do not leave the `hint` field blank as well.
2. If this is not the first time you turn on the device, and you want to change the name of your account:
    - Log into the admin account;
    - Open `System Preferences` -> `Users & Groups`;
    - Click the lock icon and enter admin password;
    - Click the plus icon to create a new account;
        - Follow the instructions in Step 1.
    - Log out and then log into the account created just now;
    - Delete the old account;
    - Go to `System Preferences` -> `Sharing`, change your bluetooth name;
        - Decide whether you want to delete that account's home folder.
    - Alternatively, see this [guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548) from Apple for more details.
3. Now, you should have signed in with the "right" admin account. Go to `System Preferences` -> `Users & Groups` and:
    - Make sure there is only one account (the one you are using now), except for at most one guest account;
    - Change the profile picture of the current account.
4. Connect to your favorite WiFi network.
5. Everything is done with account part. Now, re-open `System Preferences` and:
    - Go to `Language & Region`, change `first of the week` to Monday and tick the `24 hours`;
        - You may want to change the language here. If so, restart the device after the change.
    - Go to `iCloud`, log into your Apple iCloud account;
        - It is important to do this step here, since this will sync your personalized data to this device.
    - Go to `Dock`, un-tick `Show recently used applications`;
    - Go to `Mission Control` -> `Hot Corners`, set the right-bottom corner to trigger sleep;
    - Go to `Security & Privacy` -> `Firewall`, turn on the firewall;
    - Go to `Display` -> `Night Shift`, turn on and choose 01:00 - 07:00;
    - Go to `Keyboard` -> `Input Method`, select Chinese Pinyin and English;
    - Go to `Date & Time` -> `Clock`, tick to show date.
6. You may need to re-start the device now.
7. Open the `Safari` browser and:
    - Verify the favourite items are synced correctly;
    - Go to the following websites and sign in on this device for the fist time:
        - Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, Outlook, Amazon, ...
        - You may need to have either your Phone, Google Authenticator or [Authy](https://authy.com) with you for 2FA purpose.
    - Open Safari `Preferences`:
        - Go to `Privacy`, tick no tracking scripts;
        - Go to `Advanced`, tick show development menu item.
    - Install the following plugin for Safari browser:

    - Open `iTerm 2` -> `Preferences`:
        - Go to `General`, tick `Quit when all windows are closed`;
        - Go to `Profiles` -> `Default` and:
            - Go to `Colors` -> `Color Presets`, select `Solarized Dark`;
            - Go to `Text`, select `Blinking cursor` and change font size to 13;
                - We suggest to use Meslo LG for Powerline - Regular (download from [here](meslo_powerline_regular.ttf)).
            - Go to `Window`, change `Transparency` and `Blur` to an an appropriate value.
    - Go to `Shell` -> `Broadcast Input` and select `Show Background Pattern Indicator`;
    - Make iTerm 2 to be the default terminal;

### Java Development Environment

1. Install the latest version of Oracle JDK by `brew cask install oracle-jdk`.
    - We don't use an older version of Java because we prefer latest features. However, it is permitted to use the LTS version if the latest one is not;
    - We don't use OpenJDK because previous experiences show that it could cause issues such as missing certificate.
2. Install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) Ultimate by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) by `brew cask install intellij-idea`.

### Node.js & ECMAScript Development Environment

1. Install the latest version of Node.js runtime by `brew install node`.
2. Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) by `brew cask install webstorm`.

### Swift Development Environment

1. Install Xcode (bundled with Swift, iOS & macOS SDK) from App Store.
2. Go to `Xcode` -> `Preferences`:
    - Go to `Accounts`, sign into your Apple ID (bundled with Apple Developer account);
    - Go to `Navigation`, select `Uses Focused Editor` as `Navigation` option.

### Python Development Environment

1. Use the Python 3 built into MacOS, and do NOT install using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) or the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org).
    - [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) has come to its end-of-life as of January 1, 2020. Never use Python 2 anymore unless necessary.
    - Do NOT add alias to point `python` to `python3`, as this can be confusing. Instead, just use `python3` and `pip3`.
2. Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) by `brew cask install pycharm`.
3. To use [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) for dependency management:
    - Install Pipenv by `brew install pipenv`.
4. To use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for dependency management:
    - Create a new virtual environment for your project by `python3 -m venv .env/`;
    - Activate the virtual envrionment created by `source .env/bin/activate`;
    - Install dependency inside the virtual environment by `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Never use [easy_install](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html) as it has been [deprecated](https://packaging.python.org/discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/).

### Go Development Environment

1. Install the latest version of Go by `brew install go`.
2. Install [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) by `brew cask install goland`.
    - Go to `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> `Installed`, disable `IDE Features Trainer`.
    - Go to `Preferences` -> `Tools` -> `File Watchers`, add `go fmt`.
3. Setup the necessary environment variables in `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
# Adds path variables for Go development.
export GOPATH="/Users/<account name>/gopath"
export PATH="/Users/<account name>/gopath/bin:$PATH"
```

### MySQL Development Environment

1. Install the latest version of MySQL server by `brew install mysql`.
2. Start the MySQL instance at the background via `brew services start mysql`.
3. Secure the MySQL instance with `mysql_secure_installation`:
    - We recommend to use the same password as MacOS login password;
    - For local development, it is fine to not use the `VALIDATE PASSWORD` component;
    - After that, you can login as `root` with `mysql -u root -p` (for password prompt).
4. Create a new MySQL user with the **same** username as MacOS account:
    - We give all privileges to this account. However, we only allow login from localhost;
    - Login as `root` with `mysql -u root -p`;
    - Create a new user by `CREATE USER '<username_here>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password_here>';`;
    - Grant all privileges by `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '<username_here>'@'localhost';`;
    - You can try to login now with `mysql -p`.
5. Install a MySQL client with GUI, [Sequel Pro](https://www.sequelpro.com) by `brew cask install sequel-pro`.

### PostgreSQL Development Environment

1. Install the latest version of PostgreSQL server by `brew install postgresql`.
2. Start the MySQL instance at the background via `brew services start postgresql`.
3. This installation should help you create a superuser with the **same** username as MacOS account, but with no password. To change the password:
    - First, connect to the database by `psql template1`, where `template1` is the template database shipped with PostgreSQL;
    - Change password by `ALTER USER <username_here> PASSWORD 'new_password_here';`;
    - Now, remove the default database created by `DROP DATABASE postgres;`;
    - Then, create a new database with the **same** name as MacOS account by `CREATE DATABASE <username_here>;`.
4. Install a PostgreSQL client with GUI, [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) by `brew cask install postico`.

### Latex Writing Environment

1. Download [MikTex](https://miktex.org/) from [here](https://miktex.org/download).
    - Different from most online guides, we do NOT use [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/);
    - Make a private installation so that MikTex is only accessible to the current user;
    - Add the folder `~/bin/` to the current user's path variable.
2. Make sure the latest version of [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com) has been installed on your laptop.
    - There is no need to install any extra package(s) because [LatexTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) is shipped together with Sublime in the recent versions.
3. Create a build system for Latex by `Tools -> Build System -> New Build System...`:
```json
{
    "shell_cmd": "pdflatex \"${file}\"",
    "selector": "text.tex.latex"
}
```
4. Optionally, you may want to install [Skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/) for reverse search capability.
